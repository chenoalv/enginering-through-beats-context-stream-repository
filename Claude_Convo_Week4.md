Here's a brief context stream of our recent interactions:

You created a new beat_maker.html file with the code I provided earlier.
We discussed how to link this new interactive page to your main README.md file.
You added the link to the README.md file successfully.
There were some issues with the changes not appearing on the rendered website, which we troubleshooted.
You confirmed that the beat maker is now running properly.
Now, you're interested in enhancing the beat maker with more colors, sounds, and features.
