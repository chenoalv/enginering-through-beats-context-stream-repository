Context Stream: Recent Conversation Summary

Homepage Redesign Discussion:
We discussed redesigning the homepage for the "Engineering Thru Beats" project.
Key elements requested: cool, lowkey, clean aesthetic with colors inspired by FL Studio (fruity loops) beatmaking software.
Suggested incorporating graffiti-style bubble letters for the title, possibly animated.
Planned to include sections on careers in producing, including realistic salary information and the impact of engineering degrees on earnings.
Proposed adding an interactive beat pad element to the page.
Discussed including testimonials from professional producers or engineers.
README.md File Update:
Reviewed the current README.md file for the "engineering-through-beats-context-stream-repository".
Initially misunderstood the request and suggested adding a Week 4 link.
Corrected the misunderstanding and added a Week 6 link to the README.md file.
The new entry follows the existing format: "Week 6: Advanced Techniques"
Suggested content for Week 6 includes exploring complex audio processing methods and implementing advanced mixing strategies.
Codeword Establishment:
Agreed to use "wakanda" as a codeword to indicate when we need to revisit and revise the homepage design.
