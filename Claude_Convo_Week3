Certainly! I'm glad to hear the images are now displaying correctly. Let's recap what we've done and where we are now:

1. We successfully added an "images" folder to your GitHub repository.
2. You uploaded several images related to music production and beats to this folder.
3. We updated your HTML code (beats_with_audio.html) to include these images, making sure the file names in the code matched exactly with the actual image files, including correct capitalization.
4. The images are now displaying on your website, which is a great improvement.

The next issue you've identified is picture resizing. This is a common challenge when working with web design, as images can sometimes appear too large or small depending on the device or screen size.

Currently, your CSS has a basic responsive setup for images:

```css
img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    display: block;
    margin: 20px 0;
}
```

This ensures that images don't overflow their container, but it doesn't provide fine-grained control over their size or aspect ratio.

To address picture resizing, we could consider a few approaches:

1. Setting specific widths for images
2. Using CSS to create consistent image sizes or aspect ratios
3. Implementing more advanced responsive image techniques

Before we proceed with image resizing, it would be helpful to know:

1. Are all images appearing too large, or are some too small?
2. Do you have a specific size in mind for the images?
3. Would you prefer the images to be a consistent size, or should they vary based on content?
4. Are there any particular images that are causing more issues than others?

Once you provide this information, we can work on tailoring the image sizing to better fit your needs and improve the overall look of your webpage.
